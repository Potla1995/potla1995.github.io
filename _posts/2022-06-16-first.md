This is a test blog post. I decided to switch my academic page template to academicpages.github.io, and this is the first test post to make sure the blog system works as intended.

# Testing LaTeX
One of the main things that need to be tested is whether this supports LaTeX markdown.

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

If it doesn't, then I'll try figuring out a way to embed markdown posts and jupyter notebooks into the website. Without these, the blog feature would be pretty useless.

For now, signing out!
