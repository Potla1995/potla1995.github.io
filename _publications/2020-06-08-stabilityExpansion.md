The classical Kruskal-Katona theorem gives a tight upper bound for the size of
an $r$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ as a function of the size of its shadow.
Its stability version was obtained by Keevash who proved that if the size of $\mathcal{H}$
is close to the maximum, then $\mathcal{H}$ is structurally close to a complete $r$-uniform hypergraph.
We prove similar stability results for two classes of hypergraphs
whose extremal properties have been investigated by many researchers:
the cancellative hypergraphs and hypergraphs without expansion of cliques.
