For fixed $k\ge 2$, determining the order of magnitude of the number of edges in an $n$-vertex bipartite graph not containing $C_{2k}$, the cycle of length $2k$, is a long-standing open problem.
We consider an extension of this problem to triple systems.
In particular, we prove that the number of triples in an $n$-vertex triple system which does not contain a $C_6$ in the link of any vertex, has order of magnitude $n^{7/3}$.
Additionally, we construct new families of dense $C_6$-free bipartite graphs with $n$ vertices and $n^{4/3}$ edges in order of magnitude.
