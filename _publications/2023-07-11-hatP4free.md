Let $P_4$ denote the path graph on $4$ vertices.
The suspension of $P_4$, denoted by $\widehat P_4$, is the graph obtained via adding an extra vertex and joining it to all four vertices of $P_4$.
In this note, we demonstrate that for $n\ge 8$, the maximum number of triangles in any $n$-vertex graph not containing $\widehat P_4$ is $\left\lfloor n^2/8\right\rfloor$.
Our method uses simple induction along with computer programming to prove a base case of the induction hypothesis.
